Wrapper for pocketsphinx. Assumes that the libraries are already installed in your system.  

On Debian / Ubuntu run: ```sudo apt-get install pocketsphinx```  
For arch there is an aur package: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pocketsphinx/   

Also depends on Secret Rabbit Code (libresampler) for optional realtime resampling http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/
